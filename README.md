Family Office Protocol üè°üíö
===========================

**Every Family Deserves a Family Office** - Democratizing DeFi through collective liquidity management on Uniswap v4

üéØ Problem Statement
--------------------

DeFi promises financial inclusion but remains inaccessible to everyday users:

-   **High financial barriers**: Individual LPs need $100k+ for meaningful diversification
-   **Whale dominance**: Small players get crushed by impermanent loss
-   **Gas costs**: Managing 20 positions costs $2,400 in gas fees alone
-   **Technical complexity**: Professional strategies require deep expertise

üí° Our Solution
---------------

**Family Office Protocol** enables families to pool their PYUSD together in one click and act as a single liquidity provider with a sophisticated strategy in Uniswap v4 pools. By sharing resources and risk, families achieve:

-   ‚úÖ **49% reduction in impermanent loss** through 20-position diversification
-   ‚úÖ **98% gas savings** through collective rebalancing
-   ‚úÖ **One-click access** to institutional-grade strategies
-   ‚úÖ **Equal profit sharing** regardless of deposit size


ü§ù Big vision
---------------

**Empowering ordinary people to collectivise and participate in the trustless world of Defi more easily by leveraging real world trusted relationships at protocol level**

Family Office started with a simple question: how do you get your mom to invest in crypto? You don‚Äôt do it with just another flashy dapp ‚Äî you need to do it by building trust directly into the protocol.

In traditional finance, a ‚Äúfamily office‚Äù is a specialised financial management firm for the ultra-rich families. But why should wealth coordination be a privilege of the few? Every family deserves the ability to pool resources, share risk, and access the same complex financial strategies.

DeFi today is whales versus isolated individuals. We already have protocols that let strangers trade trustlessly. What‚Äôs missing are protocols that help people who already trust each other ‚Äî families, friends ‚Äî collectivize and coordinate on-chain.


üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Innovation: WhalePoolWrapper Hook

Our custom Uniswap v4 hook transforms multiple family deposits into a single LP that manages 20 diversified positions:

```
Family Members (PYUSD)     ‚Üí     Wrapper Hook     ‚Üí     20 Positions in Whale Pool
    Mom: 1,000                   (Aggregates)           [2520-2940] Wide Range
    Dad: 1,500                   (Distributes)          [3150-3570] Medium Range
    Sister: 500                   (Rebalances)          [3864-4200] Tight Range
    You: 1,000                   (Shares P&L)          ... 17 more positions
```

### Mathematical Foundation

**Impermanent Loss Reduction Formula:**

```
Individual IL (1 position) = 2‚àök/(1+k) - 1 = -5.72% (for 2x price move)

Collective IL (20 positions) = Œ£(position_weight √ó position_IL √ó in_range_flag) / n
                              = -2.8% average across distributed ranges

Savings = 5.72% - 2.8% = 2.92% protected capital
```

See [math_docs.md](./math_docs.md) for complete calculations.

üöÄ Quick Start

```

#### Step 2: Deploy WhalePoolWrapper Hook

bash

```
forge script script/00_DeployWhaleWrapper.s.sol\
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8545\
    --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\
    --broadcast
```

**Note the deployed address from the output!**

#### Step 3: Create Family Pool

bash

```
# First, update WHALE_WRAPPER constant in script/01_CreateFamilyPool.s.sol with deployed address

forge script script/01_CreateFamilyPool.s.sol\
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8545\
    --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\

# Update wrapper address in script/99_DemoHappyPath.s.sol

forge script script/99_DemoHappyPath.s.sol\
    --rpc-url http://localhost:8545\
    --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\
